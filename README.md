About
-----

This is an import of the gdivelog-suunto-plugin with fixes for MacOS
serial over USB. I am not the author nor maintainer of this
package. This repo is purely here for me to keep track of the patches
made to make this work under MacOS.

If you're having trouble using gdivelog and the suunto plugin under
MacOS, try this version.
